Let’s call this web site “humble”. The correct word would probably be “lazy”, or maybe “can’t bother to”, but that’s more than one word, which maybe is just another way of showing how much I can’t bother to. You can see it running at [pcalv.es](http://pcalv.es/).

Personal web sites are a weird thing.

My previous one — and first, if you don’t count GeoCities and AngelFire pages in the early 2000s to promote [Clickteam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickteam) software-made games, but you *totally should* — was [pca.lv](http://pca.lv), built right out of college. That URL has since been appropriated by someone else, which is something I really get a kick from, you know? Like, yeah, that’s the web, URLs change hands and point to entirely different things over the years, and maybe someday people will look at, whatever, twitter.com and see something entirely different. Something built on that same geography, like cities built on top of ruins except there's no ruins left, only memory being irrevocably erased. So, not as cool or romantic or what have you.

Thanks to the Internet Archive you can view my version of [pca.lv](https://web.archive.org/web/20120203053125/http://pca.lv/), stripped of its precious stylesheets, scripts and images. Doesn’t look too bad like that, does it?
